Skills in data analysis are also crucial for finding employment in graduate-level jobs. This module will deliver an introduction to quantitative political analysis. It is based on Reiche’s typology of Quantitative Methods, and explores each of its tasks (conceptualisation and measurement, numerical data, data analysis, and interpretation) at an introductory level. The module uses the software R. This is the online companion to the seminars on PO11Q. It hosts all of the material needed for the seminars and replaces the physical worksheets which we work through in some of the seminars. This is environmentally friendlier, and once we get to working with R, it also allows you to copy / paste code directly from the code chunks in this online companion. I hope you find this useful! "],["companion-features.html", "Companion Features", " Companion Features You will find embedded in the text four different types of boxes which serve different purposes: This box appears whenever I want you to stop at a particular point in the worksheet and to flag up to me or Luis that you are done. Some explanations that will hopefully make your work with this webpage or learning the material itself easier. A brief question which tests your understanding of the previous material. This appears when you need to be careful with your coding in R to avoid problems. "],["no-seminar.html", "No Seminar", " No Seminar As this is a first-year module, there is no seminar in Week 1.

Next Week", " Introduction Introduction to Moodle The Global View The content of the module is organised into weekly folders The Weekly View In each folder, you will find the labels “Learning Outcomes” “Before the Lecture” “Lecture Materials” “Before the Seminar” “Seminar Materials”, “After the Seminar” “Useful Stuff” (sometimes) Learning Outcomes For each week you will find the learning outcomes at the top These relate to the lecture, the seminar, and the reading Lecture Here you will find the preparation you are required to complete BEFORE coming to the lecture. Here you will also find a link to the reading list detailing the readings you are expected to complete BEFORE the lecture. The slides for each lecture will be available here on the previous Friday (latest). Seminar Here you will find the preparation you are required to complete BEFORE coming to the seminar. Here you will also find a link to the reading list detailing the readings you are expected to complete BEFORE the seminar. The seminar reading is different from and additional to the lecture readings. The slides for each seminar will be available here on the previous Friday (latest). Seminar – Getting to Know R Once we start working with R, there will be little video clips introducing you to various bits and bops Which role does the quiz have? It is the formative assessment of the module As such, it gives you an overview of your progress It also gives Flo an overview of gaps and problematic areas The odd question might find its way into the exam It is non-assessed, but very important to complete What can I find under the label “Useful Stuff”? Do you know this one drawer in your house that contains all sorts of stuff? This is the “Useful Stuff” label The things in there are relevant for the topics we cover, but is complementary Fora There are a number of fora at the top of the Moodle page Please use them as intended Where can I find information on the assessment? The module has two assessments Information on these can be found in the “Assessment” folder on the Moodle page Introduction to Talis Aspire Talis Aspire is an online repository for the reading list It allows you to access resources that are available online (most are) directly How do I find a reading? Available through Moodle How do I find a reading? (contd.) Scroll to the appropriate item If you see an icon labelled on the right, click on it You will be asked to log in with your university credentials You can then click yourself through to the actual document What if the reading is not digitally available? Then, I’m afraid, you will have to go to the library in person Essential versus Recommended Reading Essential: This reading is compulsory, and the material covered in it is relevant for the exam. Recommended: If you want a different take on the same topic, or you want some more information, then read these materials. Does it make sense to buy a book? Yes, there are two core texts for this module: Fogarty (2023) Agresti (2018) Assessment Do you have any Questions? A Simple Question (?) Group Work 1 How would you measure the size of the European Union? Come together in small groups (3-4) Try to identify ways in which you would measure the size of the European Union Group Work 2 Consider the measurements you developed for the size of the EU Identify which of the items are attributes and which are measurements? Draw the conceptualisation tree and sort your items into attributes (branches) and measurements (leaves) Complete the tree so that all branches have leaves and and all leaves are attached to a branch. Prepare a short presentation of your results Next Week Homework for the Seminar, Week 3 Students as Learners: Read ALL the indicative items for the concept you chose for the assessment. Students as Researchers: Draw the conceptualisation tree for the concept you selected for the assessment Choose at least three attributes for this concept Choose two measurements per attribute "],["conceptualisation-and-measurement.html", "Conceptualisation and Measurement Self-Assessment Questions1", " Conceptualisation and Measurement Self-Assessment Questions1 Please stop here and don’t go beyond this point until we have compared notes on your answers.
